Atom Snowflake CSS
==================

Based on the [Snowflake CSS concept](https://github.com/oakmac/snowflake-css) by [Chris Oakman](https://github.com/oakmac).

For now, this package just offers options for generating a 5-character hash for the end of your CSS classes.

- `ctrl-alt-h` will insert a new hash at the cursor location.
- `ctrl-alt-shift-h` will insert a new hash at the cursor location and then copy that hash to the clipboard.
